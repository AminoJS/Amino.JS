Amino.JS is a Javascript library for access to the Narvii/Amino API.

## Getting Started

To start using this library is easy.
First include it on your project
```js
var Amino = require("amino.js");
```
From here, you can choose 2 options.
Use the modules directly
```js
const sid = await Amino.login('email', 'password');
// Remember, theses functions are async, so you need to use it on a async context
// Also, you have to catch the exceptions by yourself
```
Or use the framework
```js
const AminoAPI = new Amino.AminoAPI();
AminoAPI.proccessAction(Amino.login('email', 'password'), function(data){
    // Here is the success handler
}, function(error){
    // Here is the error handler
});
// Differently than the direct call, you can use the framework in a normal context(outside of a async context)
```

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for using the Amino.JS library is the Node.JS itself.
> Levi: i made a test, using a experimental build of the Node.JS for android, and i tested the Amino.JS library on it. It worked perfectly(despite a small lag due to my phone not being a pretty good one)

### Installing

Install this library is easy as
```
$ npm install amino.js
```

Or simply by cloning this repo

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to install the Jest library
```
$ npm install -g jest
```

Each test make sure that the modules and calls are working together to the Narvii Amino, making sure it isn't causing any type of problem(like calling a inexistent endpoint)

## Deployment

To deploy, it's recommended to make a handler for the SID(Session ID), to avoid any type of session leaking, or session hijack.
